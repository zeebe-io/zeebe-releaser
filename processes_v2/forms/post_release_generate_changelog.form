Additionally, you'll also need a Github 'Personal Access Token' that can be generated in [your Github's settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens). The token needs to have `public_repo` scope. For completeness, we will pass the token into `zcl` as a parameter but you can set it as an environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN`.\n\nBefore continuing, make sure to fetch the latest changes from the repository, as otherwise you may not get the right change log.\n\n```sh\ngit fetch --all --tags\ngit checkout release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-ALPHA\ngit rebase\n```\n\nNext, add the release labels to release's issues, specifying the previous and current release in place of `ZCL_FROM_REV` and `ZCL_TARGET_REV`, respectively. `ZCL_TARGET_REV` should be replaced with the tag name for the version you are releasing, and `ZCL_FROM_REV` should be replaced as the tag name for the previous version, based on the release type:\n\n- ALPHA: the tag for the latest alpha on the current minor version. e.g. if you're releasing 1.2.0-alpha2, then `ZCL_FROM_REV=1.2.0-alpha1`. If there was no alpha version yet, then it would be the previous minor version. e.g. if you're releasing 1.2.0-alpha1, then `ZCL_FROM_REV=1.1.0`\n- PATCH: the tag for the previous patch version on the same minor branch. e.g. if you're releasing 1.2.3, then `ZCL_FROM_REV=1.2.2`.\n- MINOR: the tag for the previous minor version. e.g. if you're releasing 1.3.0, then `ZCL_FROM_REV=1.2.0`.\n\n> As there may be many patch release on a single version, it's simpler for users to take the change log as the list of changes from version X since version X-1, as otherwise they would have to figure out where the versions branched off.\n\nRun the following from zeebe repository folder:\n\n```sh\nzcl add-labels --token=GITHUB_TOKEN --from=ZCL_FROM_REV --target=ZCL_TARGET_REV --label='Release: ZCL_TARGET_REV' --org camunda-cloud --repo zeebe\n```\n\nThis will add labels to the issues in GitHub. You can verify this step by looking at closed issues. They should now be tagged with the release.\n\nAfter that, generate the change log entries for the release:\n\n```sh\nzcl generate --token=GITHUB_TOKEN --label='Release: ZCL_TARGET_REV' --org camunda-cloud --repo zeebe\n```\nThis command will print markdown code to the console. You will need to manually insert this output into the release **draft**. See: https://github.com/camunda-cloud/zeebe/releases\n",
