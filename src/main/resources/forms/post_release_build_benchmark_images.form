First, make sure to pull all tags from upstream.\n\n```sh\ngit fetch --all\n```\n\nNext, we can use the release script available in the project folder. From the root of the project:\n\n```sh\ncd benchmark/project\n./release -p <MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-ALPHA>\n```\n\nThis will build the worker and starter images for this tag, and push them. If you wish to test them before pushing, you can omit the `-p` flag; the images will be built locally but will not be pushed.\n\nThis script is safe to run in parallel multiple times if you wish to run multiple releases.",
