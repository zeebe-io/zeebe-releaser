Finally, make sure that the examples do not use deprecated code as well.\n\nTo do so, make sure to clone the repository locally. Checkout a new branch, `zeebe-release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-ALPHA`, and commit your changes to it. Then open a new PR for it, and assign it to another Zeebe team member. They will review and merge it.",
