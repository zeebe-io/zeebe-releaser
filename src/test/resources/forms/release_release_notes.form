We do not write blog posts for patch or alpha releases.\n\nThe next step is to prepare a document where you can gather the team's blog post input asynchronously. Create a new document [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DTIeswnEEq-NggJ25rm2BsDjcCQpDape?usp=sharing) titled `Zeebe & Operate X.Y.Z Release Notes`. Once done, share it with the team and remind them to add their notes for the upcoming `X.Y.Z` release in there. You will be using this document later in order to write the blog post.",
